Hello! I'm currently a Senior Computer Vision & Machine Learning Engineer at [OpenSpace.ai](https://www.openspace.ai/) where I build cool 3D perception systems to help make construction more efficient. In general I am interested in computer vision based perception for 3D real world understanding using a range of sensors, particularly in unstructured environments or for robotics applications.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.ics.uci.edu/), advised by [Professor Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/). My research mainly focused on understanding the world from camera data.  More specifically I used particle based particle based non-parametric belief propagation methods to solve hard computer vision tasks in time varying systems. Example applications of my work include localization, human mesh reconstruction, 3D vision and robotics (as well as a bunch of other computer vision perception tasks).

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Modal AI](https://www.modalai.com/), a software engineer at [Tyvak (now Terran Orbital)](https://terranorbital.com/) and as an intern at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/home).  I received an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of California, Irvine.
